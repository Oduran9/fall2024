# What *is* a commit? 



+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


## Defining terms



A commit is the most important unit of git. Later we will talk about what git as a whole is in more detail, but understanding a commit is essential to understanding how to fix things using git. 

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}



In CS we often have multiple, overlapping definitions for a term depending on our goal. 

In intro classes, we try really hard to only use one definition for each term to let you focus. 

Now we need to contend with multiple definitions


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


These definitons could be based on 
- what it *conceptually* represents
- its *role* in a larger system
- what its *parts* are
- how it is *implemented*
- 
+++{"lesson_part":"main"}



for a commit, today, we are going to go through all of these, with lighter treatment on the implementation for today, and more detail later. 


## Conceptually, a commit is a snapshot

![storing data as snapshots over time](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/snapshots.png)

::::{margin}
```{tip}
{bdg-success}`community` a better caption and alt text for the image is

```
::::


git takes a full *snapshot* of the repo at each commit.  

Under the hood, it only makes a *new* copy of files that have changed because it uses the same technique to store each snapshot, so any files that have not changed, do not create new files inside of git. 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}



## A commit's role is central to git

a commit is the basic unit of what git manages

All other git things are defined relative to commits


- branches are pointers to commits that move
- tags are pointers to commits that do not move
- trees are how file path/organization information is stored for a commit
- blobs are how files contents are stored when a commit is made


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}



## Parts of a commit

We will learn about the structure of a commit by inspecting it. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
First we will go back to our `gh-inclass` repo

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd Documents/inclass/systems/gh-inclass-brownsarahm/
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


We can use `git log` to view past commits



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git log
```

    Revert "start organizing"
    
    This reverts commit 9120d9d88aa587e4ffda1ee9aa8c3dcf8f764f7e.

```


here we see some parts: 
- hash (the long alphanumeric string)
- (if merge)
- author
- time stamp
- message

but we know commits are supposed to represent some content and we have no information about that in this view

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


the hash is the *unique identifier* of each commit

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}



we can view individual commits with `git cat-file` and at least 4 
characters of the hash or enough to be unique.  We will try 4 characters 
and I will use the first visible commit above, that is highlighted

`git cat-file` has  different modes:
- `-p` for pretty print
- `-t` to return the type
  
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p 1e2a
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
:emphasize-lines: 2

committer Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1727199044 -0400

include readmen content
```

Here we see the actual parts of a commit file: 
- a pointer to a tree
- a pointer to a parent commit (highlighted)
- author info with timestamp
- committer info with timestamp
- commit message


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

::::{sidebar} What is the PGP signature?

[Signed commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) are extra authentication that you are who you say you are. 

The commits that are labeled with the `verified` tag on GitHub.com

If we pick a commit from the history on GitHub that does not have `verified` on it, then we can see it does not have the PGP signature, but some do. 

::::
+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

### Commit parents help us trace back

kind of like a linked list 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
we can use the hash of the parent in the output above
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p 87c7
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
tree 06895b0f89062a5d9d12b5de5a068dc253f27092
parent d2d1fac72642204bfdcebc7703d786615b8de934
author Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1727198616 -0400
committer Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1727198616 -0400

stop tracking
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

### Commit trees are the hash of the content

The snapshot is stored via a tree, we can use `git cat-file` to look at the tree object too. 

The tree being a separate object from the overall commit allows us to be able to  "edit" a 
message or "change" the parent of a commit; we actually make a *new* commit with the same tree. 

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}
let's look at the tree for that commit. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p 0689
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
:emphasize-lines: 4
040000 tree 263fb9d22090e88edd2bf1847c24c3511de91b49	.github
100644 blob 9fdc6b1b8d6b0916ef50b0a37e8c31999117016d	.gitignore
100644 blob 9ece5efa25710c8fad7d9f210928785b5362b06f	CONTRIBUTING.md
100644 blob 2d232a2231c650dc4094606797fe0bd3e0ce4c65	LICENSE.md
100644 blob b8eb6e89c6295e574ee5e3363d51c917a16797ff	README.md
040000 tree f596404cd28ea4bad49ff73fb4884049ab0e31f2	docs
100644 blob 39d5708913a6c708d1a505cde6da544785c086a6	setup.py
040000 tree 8c3cc97ca6446c270ca0b8f7d4ce640a6e81e468	src
040000 tree d3980efccf4856f0c61a6a16ed40be534c5230a5	tests
```

in this we have several columns:
- mode (indicates normla file or directory in the working directory)
- `git` object type (block or tree)
- hash of the object
- its file name in the working directory

The highlighted line for `LICENSE.md` we all have the same hash (as long as you picked a commit and tree after that file was created). This is because the hashis of the *contents* and the files all do have the same contents



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
### Trees point to blobs of the file content

We can also use `git cat-file` to view a blob. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p 2d23
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash

++{"lesson_part":"main"}




## Commits are implemented as files 

commits are stored in the `.git` directory as files.  git itself *is* a file system, or a way of storing information.  


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


Everything the git program uses is stored in the `.git` directory, you can think of that like all of the variables the program would need if it ran all the time. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
COMMIT_EDITMSG	REBASE_HEAD	index		packed-refs
FETCH_HEAD	config		info		refs
HEAD		description	logs
ORIG_HEAD	hooks		objects
```

the ones in all caps are simple pointers and the others are other formats. 
+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


Most of the content is in th `objects` folder, git objects are the items that get stores. 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Recall, we had seen the `HEAD` pointer before
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/HEAD
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
ref: refs/heads/organization
```
which stores our current branch
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



Most of the content is in the `objects` folder, git objects are the items that get stores. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git/objects/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
06	29	46	72	93	ab	c7	e9
0c	2d	4c	76	94	b0	ca	f1
0e	38	5b	7a	99	b1	cb	f5
10	39	5f	7c	9d	b8	d2	f9
19	3a	62	85	9e	c0	d3	info
1e	3c	63	87	9f	c2	d8	pack
1f	3d	66	8c	a3	c3	dd
25	45	70	91	a8	c5	e0
```
We see a lot more folders here than we had commits.  This is because there are three types of objects. 


+++{"lesson_part":"site"}
### a commit is a type of git object

This is a *class diagram* for the `git object`s:

```{mermaid}

    List:

## Commit messages are essential 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}



A git commit message must exist and is *always* for people, but can also be for machines. 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}



the [conventional commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) is a format of commits

if you use this, then you can use automated tools to generate a full change log when you release code

Note: switching to '1e2a'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c <new-branch-name>

Or undo this operation with:

## Experience Report Evidence

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Besides a linked list, what other data structures or algorithms does git use on its inner workings?

the main algorithm it uses is hashing. 

More detail here is a good explore badge. 

### Why did running `ls .git/objects` had no files even when I have a commit history?

git compresses content into packfiles at times. This is rare, but can happen. 

### Is the only reason I would need to sign a commit is to show that I am the one dispersing it so it doesn't seem like spam or a virus? or should signing commits become a frequent practice?

the answer is yes to both questions

### When I entered "git cat-file -p 39d5" in the command line, the result was "file with function with instructions for pip". What does this mean?

your blob object 39d5 is a fil with that contents like: 

```{code-block}
:name: ??
file with function with instructions for pip
```

we do not yet know its filenmae, but that is what this is. 

### What is the reason for tags? Are they means of labeling? Or means of access?

they are for labeling and for creating fixed "versions" that can be used for a "release". For example, in calss I use tags to create releases and then those make notifcations, but for software releases are like the times we push to users.
