# What *is* git? 
Last week, we learned about what a commit is and then we took a break from how git works, to talk more about how developers communicate about code

Today we will learn what git is more formally. 

```{tip}

We will go in and out of topics at times, in order to provides what is called *spaced repetition*, repeating material or key concepts with breaks in between.  

Using git correctly is a really important goal of this course because git is an opportunity for you to demonstrate a wide range of both practical and conceptual understanding. 

So, I have elected to interleave other topics with git to give core git ideas some time to simmer and give you time to practice them before we build on them with more depth at git.  


Also, we are both learning git and *using* git as a motivating example of other key important topics. 
``

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Why so much git? 

Today, we are going to learn *what* git is and later we will learn more details of how it is implemented.  

Remember we are spending so much time with git for two reasons: 
1. it is an important developer tool
2. it demonstrates important conceptual ideas that occur in other areas of CS


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

[git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is the official reference on git.


this includes other spoken languages as well if that is helpful for you.




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## git definition


From here, we have the full definition of git

[git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface written on top of it.](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain)




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We do not start from that point, because these documents were written for target audience of working developers who are familar with other, old version control systems and learning an *additional* one. 

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

Most of you, however, have probably not used another version control system. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Git is a File system


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Content-addressable filesystem means a key-value data store.


+++{"lesson_part": "site","type":"solution"}

some examples of key-value pairs that you have seen in computer science broadly, and in this course specficially

- python dictionaries
- pointers (address,content)
- parameter, passed values
- yaml files


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

What this means is that you can insert any kind of content into a Git repository, for which Git will hand you back a unique key you can use later to retrieve that content.




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Git is a Version Control System




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

In the before times

![PhD comics final.doc comic](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive/phd101212s.gif)




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

git stores **snapshots** of your work each time you commit.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

![snapshot of 5 versions of 3 files](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/snapshots.png)


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

it uses 3 stages:


![3 stages in git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/images/areas.png)

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

These three stages are the in relation to your working directory, and potentially remotes.  

So in broader context, the [git visual cheatsheet](https://ndpsoftware.com/git-cheatsheet.html#loc=index;) is a more complete picture and has commands overlayed with the concept. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}



## Git has two sets of commands

- Porcelain: the user friendly VCS
- Plumbing: the internal workings- a toolkit for a VCS



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We have so far used git as a version control system.  A version control system, in general, will have operations like commit, push, pull, clone.  These may work differently under the hood or be called different things, but those are what something needs to have in order to keep track of different versions.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The plumbing commands reveal the *way* that git performs version control operations.  This means, they implement the git file system operations for the git version control system.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

You can think of the plumbing vs porcelain commands like public/private methods.  As a user, you only need the public methods (porcelain commands) but those use the private ones to get things done (plumbing commands).  We will use the plumbing commands over the next few classes to examine what git *really* does when we call the porcelain commands that we will typically use.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Git is distributed





+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

What does that mean?  



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Git runs locally.  It can run in many places, and has commands to help sync across remotes, but git does not require one copy of the repository to be the "official" copy and the others to be subordinate.  git just sees repositories.




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

For human reasons, we like to have one "official" copy and treat the others as local copies, but that is a social choice, not a technological requirement of git. Even though we will typically use it with an offical copy and other copies, having a tool tht does not care, makes the tool more flexible and allows us to create workflows, or networks of copies that have any relationship we want.




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


It's about the workflows, or the ways we socially *use* the tool.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Subversion  Workflow

## Starting a git repo locally

We made this folder, but we have not used any git operations on it yet, it is actually not a git repo, which we *could* tell from the output above, but let's use git to inspect and get another hint. 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Now we will return to the `tiny-book` folder we made last class.  This is a jupyterbook, meaning the command `jupyter-book build .` works in the directory. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd tiny-book/
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
_build			markdown-notebooks.md
_config.yml		markdown.md
_toc.yml		notebooks.ipynb
intro.md		references.bib
logo.png		requirements.txt
```
we see all fo the files
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -a
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
.			logo.png
..			markdown-notebooks.md
_build			markdown.md
_config.yml		notebooks.ipynb
_toc.yml		references.bib
intro.md		requirements.txt
```
but no .git!
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and if we try a git command
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```
This tells us the `.git` directory is missing form the current path and all parent directories. 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
pwd
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems/tiny-book
```
nor is any other fold in this list, since it checks the parents. 




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

To make it a git repo, we use `git init` with the path we want to initialize, which currently is `.`


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git init .
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:

```


+++{"lesson_part": "site","type":"heading"}
:::{sidebar}
(nomaster)=
### Retiring racist language
Historically the default branch was called master.

- [derived from a master/slave analogy](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html) which is not even how git works, but was adopted terminology from other projects
- [GitHub no longer does](https://github.com/github/renaming)
- [the broader community is changing as well](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/)
- [git allows you to make your default not be master](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.656.v4.git.1593009996.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)
- [literally the person who chose the names "master" and "origin" regrets that choice](https://twitter.com/xpasky/status/1271477451756056577) the name main is a more accurate and not harmful term and the current convention.  
::::
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we'll change our default branch to main
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git branch -m main
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and check in with git now
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	_build/
	_config.yml
	_toc.yml

	markdown-notebooks.md
	markdown.md
	notebooks.ipynb
	references.bib

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
this time it works and we see a two important things:
- there are no previous commits
- all of the files are untracked
+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Handling Built files


The built site files are compeltey redundant, content wise, to the original markdown files. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

the build folder is compeltely redundant, we can delete it
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
rm -rf _build/
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
confirm it is gone
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
_config.yml		markdown.md
_toc.yml		notebooks.ipynb

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

then re-build to replace it

## How do I push a repo that I made locally to GitHub?
Right now, we do not have any remotes, so if we try to push it will fail. Next we will see how to fix that. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

First let's confirm 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fatal: No configured push destination.
Either specify the URL from the command-line or configure a remote repository using

    git remote add <name> <url>

and then push using the remote name

    git push <name>

```
it fails, but it tells us how to fix it.  This is why inspection is so powerful in 
developer tools, that is where we developers give one another hints. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Right now, we do not have any remotes


+++{"lesson_part": "main", "type":"redaction"}

For today, we will create an empty github repo shared with me, by accepting the assignment linked in prismia or ask a TA/instructor if you are making up class.

More generally, you can [create a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo)

That default page for an empty repo if you do not initiate it with any files will give you the instructions for what remote to add.




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we add the remote

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git remote add origin https://github.com/compsys-progtools/tiny-book-brownsarahm-1.git
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Then we can push
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fatal: The current branch main has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin main

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
once we link the branch
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git push -u origin main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

## How does git do all these things?

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can use the bash command `find` to search the file *system* note that this does not search the contents of the files, just the names.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
.git/objects//69/fa449dd96e2405945b2e4cff2fd0ab8b102097

This is a lot of files! It's more than we have in our working directory. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This is a consequence of git taking snap shots and tracking both the actual contents of our working directory **and** our commit messages and other meta data about each commit. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Git Variables

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


the program `git` does not run continously the entire time you are using it for a project.  It runs quick commands each time you tell it to, it's goal is to manage files, so this makes sense.  This also means that important information that `git` needs is also saved in files.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can see the files that it has by listing the directory: 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
AUTO_MERGE	ORIG_HEAD	index		refs
COMMIT_EDITMSG	config		info
FETCH_HEAD	description	logs
HEAD		hooks		objects
```

the files in all caps are like gits variables.  



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Lets look at the one called `HEAD` we have interacted with `HEAD` before when resolving merge conflicts.


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/HEAD 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
ref: refs/heads/main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

`HEAD` is a pointer to the currently checked out branch. 

The other files with `HEAD` in their name are similarly pointers to other references, named corresponding to other things. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}



## Git Objects

There are 3 types:
- blob objects: the content of your files (data)
- tree objects: stores file names and groups files together (organization)
- Commit Objects: stores information about the sha values of the snapshots

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    class tree{
    List: 
      - hash: blob
      - string: type
      - string:file name 
    }
    class commit{
        hash: parent
        hash: tree
        string: message
        string: author 
        string: time
    }
    class blob{
        binary: contents
    }
    class object{
        hash: name

    }
    object <|-- blob
    object <|-- tree
    object <|-- commit
```

## Experience Report Evidence

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Can you clarify the difference between working in local repos, github repos, and github codespaces and how they all integrate?

- a local repo is a folder on your computer
- a github repo is the copy on the github.com server that the website interface interacts with
- a github codespace is a virtual machine on an Azure server that you can use VScode with
- a codespace is a *local* copy as far as git is concerned, since you have local access
- both types of local repos can be pushed and pulled to github.com

### how were the older verion controls and what similar features did it have to git that remains present in git present day?

this is a good explore badge topic. 

### why is there a difference between Porcealin and Plumbing commands when they both interact with the file system and are dependent on its contents?
> is it the operatiions that are performed by the commands? Or is it more to do with the level that they interact with the file system.


the porcelain commands essentially call the plumbing comamnds. In normal day to day use you only need the porcelain commands, plumbing are the low level details. 

### Can the list of commit (objects) ever become long enough to cause issues?


Technically, yes, practically no. the badges for today will have you investigate this idea.
