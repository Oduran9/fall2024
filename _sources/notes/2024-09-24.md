# Patterns in git and bash

We will continue working in the `gh-inclass` repo

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd gh-inclass-brownsarahm/

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We added a bunch of files so that we can orgaize them. 
```{code-cell} bash

## Making a folder

First, we'll make a directory with `mkdir`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mkdir docs
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
next we will move a file there with `mv`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv philosophy.md docs/
```

move takes 2 inputs: a source and destination. 
+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we can see what happened
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
API.md			abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	tests_alt.py
LICENSE.md		docs			tests_helpers.py
README.md		example.md		tests_imp.py
_config.yml		helper_functions.py	tsets_abc.py
_toc.yml		important_classes.py
about.md		scratch.ipynb
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls docs/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
philosophy.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

what this does is change the path of the file from `.../github-inclass-brownsarahm/philosophy.md` to `.../github-inclass-brownsarahm/docs/philosophy.md`



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

git does not quite understand though

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	deleted:    philosophy.md

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	docs/

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```
it sees a missing file (thinks it is deleted) and a new folder
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

if we stage the folder, it will start tracking it
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add docs/
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   docs/philosophy.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	deleted:    philosophy.md

```
now it sees a new file and a deleted one
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
if we add everything
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	renamed:    philosophy.md -> docs/philosophy.md

```
now it can tell we renamed

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Undoing a change, only in git

let's first make change to the README
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo " ">>README.md 
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	renamed:    philosophy.md -> docs/philosophy.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we can add the readme  too 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git add .
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   README.md
	renamed:    philosophy.md -> docs/philosophy.md

```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we decide to not put these two changes in the same commit, we can *unstage* the file
without losing our changes with `restore` and its `--staged` option

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git restore --staged README.md 
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch organization
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	renamed:    philosophy.md -> docs/philosophy.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   README.md

```
Now only the philosophy change will be commited


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Now we make that commit

    add a note

commit 991ee65fa0d0692bd097915daec156aa95eba82f (origin/main, origin/HEAD, main)
```

```{important}
this opens a program so we press {kbd}`q` to exit. 
```

recall from the output above, that commit `9120d9` above was like: 

```{code-block} console
[organization 9120d9d] start organizing (move philosophy)
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rename philosophy.md => docs/philosophy.md (100%)
```

it moved `philosophy.md` to `docs/philosophy.md` and


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Now let's undo the organizing one, but keep the reame one my hash begins with `9120d9`
so I pass that to `git revert` but you will pass a different hash

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git revert 9120d9
```

git revert requires a message so vimwill open use {kbd}`esc` to be sure you 
are in command mode then type `:wq` and press {kbd}`enter`/{kbd}`return` to
exit vim

```
note that this is a new `commit, here hash `a3904a0` and it does the **opposite** of the 
one we reverted `9120d9`, so it moves `docs/philosphy.md` to `philosophy.md`

## More moving files

```{code-cell} bash

_config.yml		important_classes.py	tsets_abc.py
_toc.yml		philosophy.md

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we do actually want that folder so we make it again
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mkdir docs
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and move the file there
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv philosophy.md docs/
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we can move more files more than one at a time by listing multiple paths it moves all but the last one to 
the last one, which must be a directory, not a file. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv about.md API.md example.md docs/
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we can see that it works
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]

_toc.yml		scratch.ipynb
abstract_base_class.py	setup.py
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Moving with patterns 

We can use the `*` [wildcard operator](https://tldp.org/LDP/GNU-Linux-Tools-Summary/html/x11655.htm) to move all files that match the pattern. We'll start with the two `yml` [(yaml)](https://yaml.org/)
files that are both for the documentation.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv *.yml docs/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
again we use `ls` to see it
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
CONTRIBUTING.md		docs			tests_alt.py
LICENSE.md		helper_functions.py	tests_helpers.py
README.md		important_classes.py	tests_imp.py
abstract_base_class.py	scratch.ipynb		tsets_abc.py
alternative_classes.py	setup.py
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and in the folder: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls docs/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
API.md		_toc.yml	example.md
_config.yml	about.md	philosophy.md
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Move is also rename

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}


We see that most of the test files start with `tests_` but one starts with
`tsets_`. We can fix this!


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

We can use `mv` to change the name as well. This is because "moving" a file and
is really about changing its path, not actually copying it from one location to
another and the file name is a part of the path.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv tsets_abc.py tests_abc.py
```



+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

This changes the path from `.../tsets_abc.py` to `.../tests_abc.py` to. It is doing the same thing as when we use it to move a file from one folder to another folder,  but changing a different part of the path. 


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

Next we make a folder for them 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mkdir tests
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

and move all of the test files there:
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we press {kbd}`tab` multiple times it shows us what matches the pattern 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv tests
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
tests/            tests_alt.py      tests_imp.py      
tests_abc.py      tests_helpers.py  
```
the folder is in there, so if we were to do `mv tests* tests/` it would give us an error
because the folder also matches `tests*` 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If we add the `_`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv tests_
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
now it's only what we want to move: 
```{code-block} console
tests_abc.py      tests_alt.py      tests_helpers.py  tests_imp.py
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
so we run this
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv tests_* tests/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
CONTRIBUTING.md		alternative_classes.py	scratch.ipynb
LICENSE.md		docs			setup.py
README.md		helper_functions.py	tests
abstract_base_class.py	important_classes.py
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls tests/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
tests_abc.py		tests_helpers.py
tests_alt.py		tests_imp.py
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Finally, we wil move the rest of they python files
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mkdir src
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv *_*.py
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
mv: important_classes.py is not a directory
```
without the target specified it tried to treat the last one as the destination and it did not work
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv *_*.py src/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
CONTRIBUTING.md	README.md	scratch.ipynb	src
LICENSE.md	docs		setup.py	tests
```

## Hidden files  and Ignoring files

+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

We are going to make a special hidden file and an extra one. We will use the following command: 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
touch .secret .gitignore
```


+++{"lesson_part":"main"}

We also learn 2 things about `touch` and `bash`:
- `touch` can make multiple files at a time
- lists in `bash` are separated by spaces and do not require brackets


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
These files will not show by default
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
CONTRIBUTING.md	README.md	scratch.ipynb	src
LICENSE.md	docs		setup.py	tests
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
but do with thw `-a` option
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -a
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
.		.github		CONTRIBUTING.md	docs		src
..		.gitignore	LICENSE.md	scratch.ipynb	tests
.git		.secret		README.md	setup.py
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

gitignore lets us *not* track certain files

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano .gitignore 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
we will ignore the secret file and all notebook files

```markdown
.secrete
*.ipynb
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

in our browser we notice the file is not there, but the .ipynb file still is 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
let's try editing it
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano scratch.ipynb 
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and checkign with git
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

Your branch is up to date with 'origin/organization'.

Changes not staged for commit:

  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   scratch.ipynb

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

it is still tracking, because `.gitignore` does not remove files from 
tracking it only prevents tracking from starting 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we can learn about git commands with `--help`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git rm --help
```

it is a program we exit with {kbd}`q`

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we want to remove it from git, but not delete it locally, so we use `--cached` option on `git rm`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git rm --cached scratch.ipynb 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

```{code-cell} bash

## Questions After Today's Class 

### What are some other useful git bash commands to ensure safety in removing, ignoring, moving, renaming, and making?

We have covered a lot of the *most* commonly used ones at this point. We will learn some more, but 
also looking up different people's bash or git cheatsheets is a good contribution to the site for a community badge. Comparing them extensively could be an explore badge

### What are other special files in git? 
Next week we will dig into how git works under the hood and that will see more 

### is .gitignore something standard from github or just a git bash thing?

it is standard to *git* no matter what host (github, bitbucket, gitlab) or terminal (mac termnial, gitbash, anaconda prompt) or shell (bash, zsh, powershell) you use. 

### How do I combine pull requests

Pull requests compare two branches. 

For example you might have 
```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"D"
    commit id:"E"
    branch prepare
    branch experience
    checkout prepare
    commit id:"do prepare work"
    checkout experience
    commit id:"init experience badge"
```

and have one PR from prepare to main and another from experience to main. 
If you change the base of the prepare one to be expereince and then merge it, then you have:

```{mermaid}
gitGraph
    commit id:"D"
    commit id:"E"
    branch prepare
    branch experience
    checkout prepare
    commit id:"do prepare work"
    checkout experience
    commit id:"init experience badge"
    merge prepare
```

and everything will show in the experience PR
