## How to store a value 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We need a few more components: 

- [mux](https://lodev.org/logicemu/#id=mux) select one of two values
- [flip-flop](https://lodev.org/logicemu/#) hold a value until told otherwise




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


[register](https://lodev.org/logicemu/#id=register)



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


this gives us SRAM which can hold a value as long as the system has power 
(1963)

## another way to physically store a value 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


DRAM uses one transistor and one capacitor. (SRAM uses 4-6 transistors)

a capacitor holds a charge for a time, but gradually fades, so it has to be refreshed



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

ROM is a diode matrix traditionally
- hardward encodes the instructions
- cannot be changed without rewiring

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

PROM
- can be reprogrammed once after device is made
- used for firmware/microcode

(programmable ROM)

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
EPROM or EEPROM
- treated like ROM
- can be erased & reprogrammed
- but not infinitely, very limited number of tmes
- holds value when power goes away, UV light or electriciy can re-program
  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

SRAM:

- is volatile; it needs power to hold a value
- is fast 
- takes up more space on the chip (uses 4-6 transistors per bit)
- typically used of cache and internal registers

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
DRAM: 
- is volatile;  it needs power to hold a value
- is slower and requires a refresh
- is small (1 transistor + 1 capacitor per bit) and space efficient
- used for the main RAM

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Flash memory 
- non-volatile; holds a value without power, can be electircally erased and re-programmed
- comprised of memory "cells" in layerd boards
- memory cells are mosfets - a different type of transistor that retains a state after power is removed and put bag
- implemented with EEPROM 
- designed for large blocks and limited writes (~10k)
- used for ssd, usb flash drives, smartphones, etc
- slow to write, fast to read
