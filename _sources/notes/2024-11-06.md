# What happens when we run code?


```{important}
We reviewed the [solution to updating your assigmnment action](https://github.com/compsys-progtools/kwl-sp24-brownsarahm/commit/16f0baaaf3f23e6210b527ffc137fd2b8a4d202f)
and how to [create issues for missing dates](https://compsys-progtools.github.io/courseutils/examples/tasktracking.html#create-a-badge-issue-for-a-specific-date)

## Starting the CPU Emulator

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Linux/MacOS

In your terminal:
```bash
cd nand2tetris/tools
```

and then 
```bash
bash CPUEmulator.sh 
```
:::

:::{tab-item} Windows

```bash
CPUEmulator.bat
```

or in file explorer, Double click on the `CPUEmulator.bat` file


:::

::::



and it will open  a new window


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

For more on how the emulator works see the [CPU Emulator Tutorial](https://www.nand2tetris.org/_files/ugd/44046b_24b3a15aa628404fbf6dacd86d7da3af.pdf).

For much more detail about how this all works [chapter 4](https://www.nand2tetris.org/_files/ugd/44046b_d70026d8c1424487a451eaba3e372132.pdf) of the related text book has description of the machine code and assembly language.

## Loading a program

We're not going to *do* project 5, which is to build a CPU, but instead to use the test programs designed to check if your personally build CPU works with the CPU Emulator they provide to *understand* a simple canonical CPU.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We're going to use the test cases from the book's project 5:

1. Load Program
2. Navigate to `nand2tetris/projects/05`

## How does the computer actually add constants?

We'll use `add.hack` first.  



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This program adds constants, 2+3.  

It is a program, assembly code that we are loading to the simulator's ROM, which is memory that gets read only by the CPU.  



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Run the simulator and watch what each line of the program does.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Notice the following:
- to compute with a constant, that number only exists in ROM in the instructions
- to write a value to memory the address register first has to be pointed to what where in the memory the value will go, then the value can be sent there



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The simulator has a few key parts:
- address register the `A`
- program counter the `PC`
- the ALU
- the D register



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If you prefer to read, see [section 5.2.1- 5.2.6 of nan2tetris book](https://www.nand2tetris.org/_files/ugd/44046b_b2cad2eea33847869b86c541683551a7.pdf)



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

- This program the first instruction puts 2 in the address register from the instructions in ROM.  
- Then it moves the 2 through the ALU to the data register (D)
- then it puts 3 on the address register
- then it adds the numbers at D and A
- then it puts 0 on the address register
- then it write the output from the ALU (D) to memory (at the location indicated by the A register)




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## The max between two numbers

To compute the maximum value `max.hack`:
- subtracts  the two numbers
- compares the difference to 0
- jumps to different lines based on if that difference is >0 or not
- assigns the address register a value accordingly
- copies one of the two values to the new location
  
:::{note}
This program assumes the two values to compare already exist in memory, the program does not set them. 
To test it, try changing the values in memory locations 0 and 1.
