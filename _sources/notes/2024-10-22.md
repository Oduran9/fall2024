# How can I automate things with bash?


So far we have used bash commands to navigate our file system as a way to learn about the file system itself. To do this we used commands like:
- `mv`
- `cd`
- `pwd`
- `ls` 
- `find`
- `rm`


*do you remember what each of those does?, no need to respond, just think through it for yourself*

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Bash is a unix shell for the GNU operating system and it has been adopted in other contexts as well.  It is the default shell on Ubuntu linux as well for example (and many others). This is why we teach it.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
A Unix shell is both a command interpreter and a programming language. As a command interpreter, the shell provides the user interface to the rich set of GNU utilities. The programming language features allow these utilities to be combined. 


Read the official definition of `bash` and a shell in [the bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Introduction)

## Inspecting an example script


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Today we will start by inspecting the github action file, first we'll navigate to the folder. 

:::{admonition} Community badge
read in and annotate using myst/jupyter tools the
file of the action file with the excerpts that show the different parts
:::

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd fall24-brownsarahm/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh repo view --web
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

## Variables in Bash



+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

From the action files what do you think the syntax for a variable in bash is? Give an example by creating a variable called `MYVAR` with the value `my_val`






+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We can create variables


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
MY_NAME='sarah'
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

notice that there are **no spaces** around the `=`. spaces in bash separate commands and options, so they cannot be in variable declarations.  



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and use them with a `$` before the variable name. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $MY_NAME 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
sarah
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



This variable is local, in memory, to the current terminal window, so if we open a separate window and try `echo $NAME` it will not work. We can also see that it does not create any file changes. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

A common mistake is to put a space around the `=` sign, this is actually considered **good style** in many other languages. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
MY_VAR = 'sarah'
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
-bash: MY_VAR: command not found
```

In bash, however, this creates an error.  When there is a space after `MY_VAR`, `bash` tried to interpet `MY_VAR` as a bash command, but then it does not find it, so it gives an error. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $MY_NAME 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
sarah
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Environment Variables

Environment variables are global. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

A common one is the `PATH`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $PATH
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin:/usr/local/bin:/System/Cryptexes/App/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/local/bin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/bin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/appleinternal/bin:/Library/TeX/texbin
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The `$` is essential syntax for recalling variables in bash. If we forget it, it treats it as a literal

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo PATH
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
PATH
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


so we get the variable **name** out instead of the variable **value**

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
the variables do still work if we chnge our path: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ../gh-inclass-brownsarahm/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo $MY_NAME 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
sarah
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

You can store environment variables to be set each time you start a terminal 
in your profile. 

- On MacOS this file is: `~/.bash_profile`
- on linux it is `~/.baschrc`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat ~/.bash_profile
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
drsmb="/Users/brownsarahm/Documents/web/drsmb-co.github.io"

alias pip=pip3
alias python=python3

export PS1="\u@\W $ "


# Setting PATH for Python 3.12
# The original version is saved in .bash_profile.pysave
PATH="/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.12/bin:${PATH}"
export PATH
```


A common one you might want to set is: 
- `PS1` the primary prompt line. Content you can use is [documented in the gnu docs](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Controlling-the-Prompt)
- `alias` lets you set another name for a program, for exmaple I use `pip` to call `pip3`






## GH Actions as an example of scripts



Check out the [github action marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) to see other actions that are available and try to get a casual level of understanding of the *types* of things that people use actions for. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}




## Bash Loops

We can also make loops like

```
for loopvar in list
do
# loop body
echo $loopvar
done
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

So, for example: 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for name in Sarah Aiden Jad
> do
> echo $name
> done
```

Notes:

- The `>` is not typed, it is what happens since the interpreter knows that
after we write the first line, the command is not complete.
- a list in bash is items with spaces, no brackets here `Sarah Aiden Jad`
- 
+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Sarah
Aiden
Jad
```
and it outputs each name as expected
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

When we get the command back with the up arrow key, it puts it all on one line, because it was one command.  The `;` (semicolon) separates the "lines"

we can change the loop variable to be anything, but good practice is something semantic, unlike the following: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for HI in Sarah Aiden Jad; do echo $HI; done
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Sarah
Aiden
Jad
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and we can add more to the list
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for HI in Sarah Aiden Jad Jordan Johsua; do echo $HI; done
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Sarah
Aiden
Jad
Jordan
Johsua
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}



## Nesting commands

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Note: bash provides a `date` command that returns the date

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
date
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Tue Oct 22 13:14:32 EDT 2024
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
CONTRIBUTING.md	README.md	scratch.ipynb	src
LICENSE.md	docs		setup.py	tests
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We can run a command to generate the list by putting it inside `$()` to run that command first.  Think kind of like PEMDAS and the `$` in bash is for variables. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
for file in  $(ls)
> do
> echo $file
> done
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

the `$()` tells bash to run that command first and then hold its output as a variable for use elsewhere

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
CONTRIBUTING.md
LICENSE.md
README.md
docs
scratch.ipynb
setup.py
src
tests
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Conditionals in bash



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can also do conditional statements

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
if test -f docs
> then
> echo "file"
> fi
```



the key parts of this: 
- `test` checks if a file or directory exists
- the `-f` option makes it check if the item is a *file*
- what to do if the condition is met goes after a `then` keyword
- the `fi` (backwards`if`) closes the if statment

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

```
this outputs nothing, because `docs` is a folder, but if we change the file it checks: 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
if test -f README.md; then echo "file"; fi
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
file
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We can put the if inside of the loop, but this is getting long so typing it all without errors is hard. 





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Script files 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can put our script into a file 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano filecheck.sh
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat filecheck.sh 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```bash
for file in $(ls)
do
  if test -f $file
  then
    echo $file "is a file"
  fi
done
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and run it with `bash <filename>`

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
bash filecheck.sh 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
CONTRIBUTING.md is a file
LICENSE.md is a file
README.md is a file
filecheck.sh is a file
scratch.ipynb is a file
setup.py is a file
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

the extension can be anything
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv filecheck.sh filecheck
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
bash filecheck
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
CONTRIBUTING.md is a file
LICENSE.md is a file
README.md is a file
filecheck is a file
scratch.ipynb is a file
setup.py is a file
```
and it still works

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
but the extension is good practice, so we will put it back
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
mv filecheck filecheck.sh
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## `gh` CLI operations 

When you are working sometimes it is helpful to be able to manipulate (or create) issues, pull requests or even releases from the command line. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This is how I post announcements. I work on the notes (a markdown file) in vs code and then I use the vscode terminal to commit, push, create a tag, and create a release. I can post the notes and notify you all that they are posted without leaving VScode at all; this makes it much simpler/faster than it would be using Brightspace




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



We can also search and filter them by piping the output to `grep` which searches the **contents** of a file (including stdin). We previously searched the file **names** with `find`.  So `find` searches the paths that exist and `grep` actually reads the contents of the files, it does so faster than many other languages would be. 




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

 
`grep` can be used with pattern matching as well 




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Learning more about `grep` is a good explore badge topic 




```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh issue list -s all | grep "Create"
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

1	CLOSED	Create a README		2024-09-17T16:50:52Z
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We can use `awk` to separate out only the number from the output
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh issue list -s all | awk '{print $1}'
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
6
3
2
1
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we can also use multiple pipes

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gh issue list -s all | grep "Create" | awk '{print $1}'
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
3
2
1
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
and we can put htis in a script

``` bash

for issue in $(gh issue list -s all | grep "Create" | awk '{print $1}')
do
gh issue view $issue >> combined_issues.md
done
```
then run that script: 
```{code-cell}
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
bash combine.sh
```

and loook at the output
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat combined_issues.md
```

## Experience Report Evidence

## Questions After Today's Class 

### Explore topics from questions
- `zsh` vs `bash`

### Where can I find the documentation for all bash syntax?

the [bash manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/) is the official reference

### How do we know when to use $ in bash when using varaibles?

Whenever you want to use the value of a variable, not declare it. 

### How can I look at the bash profile on windows? As the commands for Linux and MacOS didn't work when we looked at /.bash_profile.

I think by default it does not rely on one, but you can create one, you should create the file `.bash_profile`

### Why do we use the dollar sign ($) in the command line, instead of other symbols like # or *?

To the best of my knowledge it is just a syntactical choice that was made by the developers, but trying to find the actual history of this from reputable sources could also be an explore idea

### What is the use for `#!/bin/bash` Why is it not needed all the time?

`#!/bin/bash` tells the interpretter which shell to use.  Since we ran our file like `bash <filename>` we did not need it. 

We *would* need it for running  like `./<filename>` 

the `#!` is calked the shebang. [more in the bash docs](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#:~:text=Most%20versions%20of%20Unix%20make%20this%20a%20part%20of%20the%20operating%20system%E2%80%99s%20command%20execution%20mechanism.%20If%20the%20first%20line%20of%20a%20script%20begins%20with%20the%20two%20characters%20%E2%80%98%23!%E2%80%99)
