# How does git *make* a commit? 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Today we will dig into how git really works.  This will be a deep dive and provide a lot of details about how git creates a commit.  It will reinforce important **concepts**, which is of practical use when fixing things give you some ideas about how you might fix things when things go wrong.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Later, we will build on this more on the practical side, but these **concepts** are very important for making sense of the more practical aspects of fixing things in git.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


This deep dive in git is to help you build a correct, flexbile understanding of git so that you can use it independently and efficiently. The plumbing commands do not need to be a part of your daily use of git, but they are the way that we can dig in and see what *actually* happens when git creates a commit. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
 
 **this is also to serve as an example method you could apply in understanding another complex system**

Inspecting a system's components is a really good way to understand it and correctly understanding it will impact your ability to ask good questions and even look up the right thing to do when you need to fix things. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Also, looking at the parts of git is a good way to reinforce specific design patterns that are common in CS in a practical way.  This means that today we will also: 
- review and practice with the bash commands we have seen so far
- see a practical example of hashing
- reinforce through examples what a pointer does


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Navigate to your folder for class
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fall24-brownsarahm	tiny-book
gh-inclass-brownsarahm
```
it should have your other repos

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and, *not* be a git repo, we can confirm with: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
In contrast, if we are in a repo
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd fall24-brownsarahm/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
the command works

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

If yours worked, go up one level to be out of a repo: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd ../
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fatal: not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
```

```{important}
Today there were a lot of prismia comprehension check questions. 

If you struggled with them, you should be sure to check that you now understand the correct answer
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Creating a repo from scratch



+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

We can create an empty repo from scratch using `git init <path>`

Last time we used an existing directory like `git init .` because we were working in the directory that already existed


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


Today we will create a new directory called `test` and initialize it as a repo at the same time:


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git init test
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint:
hint: 	git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint:
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint:
hint: 	git branch -m <name>
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/brownsarahm/Documents/inclass/systems/test/.git/
```
[I get this message again, see context from previous class](nomaster)
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We can see what it did by first looking at the working directory



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fall24-brownsarahm	test
gh-inclass-brownsarahm	tiny-book
```

it made a new folder named as we said

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and we can go into that directory

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd test/
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
it is empty as expected: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and then rename the branch
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git branch -m main
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

To clarify we will look at the status
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
Notice that there are no commits, and no origin. 

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
there are no remotes at all
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git remote
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we do have the .git hidden directory though
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -a
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
.	..	.git
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls  .git/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
HEAD		description	info		refs
config		hooks		objects
```
Notice that there are no commits, and no origin. 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls ../gh-inclass-brownsarahm/.git
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
COMMIT_EDITMSG	REBASE_HEAD	index		packed-refs
FETCH_HEAD	config		info		refs
HEAD		description	logs
ORIG_HEAD	hooks		objects
```

in my inclass repo I have other files because as we do various git operations, we create other files for example the 
`COMMIT_EDITMSG`is the file that opens in vim when we forget the `-m` option

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Searching the file system


We can use the bash command `find` to search the file *system* note that this does not search the **contents** of the files, just the names.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
find .git/objects/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
.git/objects/
.git/objects//pack
.git/objects//info
```



we have a few items in that directory and the directory itself.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can limit by type, to only files with the `-type` option set to `f`


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
find .git/objects/ -type f
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

And we have no results. We have no objects yet. Because this is an empty repo 


+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
## Git Objects

Remember our 3 types of objects
- blob objects: the content of your files (data)
- tree objects: stores file names and groups files together (organization)
- Commit Objects: stores information about the sha values of the snapshots



```{mermaid}

classDiagram
    class tree{
    List: 
      - hash: blob
      - string: type
      - string:file name 
    }
    class commit{
        hash: parent
        hash: tree
        string: message
        string: author 
        string: time
    }
    class blob{
        binary: contents
    }
    class object{
        hash: name

    }
    object <|-- blob
    object <|-- tree
    object <|-- commit
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### How to create an object



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

All git objects are files stored with the name that is the hash of the content in the file




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Remember git is a content-addressable file systsem... so it uses key- value pairs. 




+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Let's create our first git object.  git uses hashes as the key. We give the hashing function some content, it applies the algorithm and returns us the hash as the reference to that object.  We can also write to our .git directory  with  this.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The `git hash-object` command works on files, but we do not have any files yet.  We can create a file, but we do not have to.  Remememer, **everything** is a file. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

When we use things like `echo` it writes to the stdout file. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "test content"
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
test content
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
which shows on our terminal. We can us a pipe to connect the stdout of on command to the stdin of the next. 

::::{margin}
:::{note}

pipes are an important content too. we're seeing them in context of real uses, and we will keep seing them. Pipes connect the std out of one command t othe std in of the next.

:::
::::

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "test content" | git hash-object --stdin
```



We can break down this command: 
- git hash-object would take the content you handed to it and merely return the unique key
- `--stdin` option tells git hash-object to get the content to be processed from stdin instead of a file
- the `|` is called a pipe (what we saw beforeÂ was a redirect) it pipes a _process_ output into the next command
- `echo` would write to stdout, withthe pip it passes that to std in of the `git-hash`



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we get back the hash:

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
d670460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

:::{warning}
if you have an odd number of quotes `"` or `'` or more open brackets `([{` than corresponding close brackets `}])` bash will wait fo you to finish.  Whenever your regular prompt is replaced by `>` it is waiting for you to finish the current command. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "
> 
> 
> 
> kjsjslf
> sdf
> jjsdkf
> "
```

and then it runs once we close with `"`
```{code-block} console



kjsjslf
sdf
jjsdkf

```
:::
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now let's run it again with a slight modification. `-w` option tells the command to also write that object to the database

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "test content" | git hash-object -w --stdin
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
d670460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and we can check if it wrote to the repository.

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
```
and we see a file that it was supposed to have!
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We do not have any files or commits though still. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}
### Viewing git objects 

We can try with `cat`
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/objects/d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
xK??OR04f(I-.QH??+I?+?K?	
```

This is binary output that we cannot understand.  Fortunately, git provides a utility. We can use `cat-file` to use the object by referencing at least 4 characters that are unique from the full hash, not the file name. (`7046` will not work, but `d670` will)

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
`cat-file` requires *an* option `-p` is for pretty print

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p d670
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
test content
```

where we see the content we put in to the hashing function


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and `-t` is for type
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -t d670
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
blob
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
:::{hint}
You can always use the `--help` on any `git` command to 
learn more about its options
:::

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

These options cannot be stacked

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -pt d670
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
error: options '-t' and '-p' cannot be used together
```

the developers did not implement it to work, but it also does not really make sense
to output both of them, because they each provide a different type of content. Using
both asks for 2 different types of content which would then not be usable in a basic 
pipe so it would be bad design in terms of the unix philosophy to do that. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Hashing a file



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

let's create a file
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "version 1" > test.txt
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
first we will check in with git:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	test.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
it can see the file, but it is untracked. 
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and now, we store it,  by hashing it

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git hash-object -w test.txt 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```
this returns the hash, this is still a hash that is the same for all of us.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and again with git status
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	test.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```
still untracked
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

but the file does exist in the git objects: 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we can check the type of this new object:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -t 83baa
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
blob
```
also a blob

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p 83baa
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
version 1
```

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

Now this is the status of our repo. 
```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    class d67046{
        + "test content"
        +(blob)
    }
    class 83baae{
       + Version 1
       + (blob)
    }
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Notice, however, that we only have one file in the working directory. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
test.txt
```

it is the one test.txt, the first blob we made had no file in the working directory associated to it. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


the workign directory and the git repo are not strictly the same thing, and can be different like this.  Mostly they will stay in closer relationship that we currently have unless we use plumbling commands, but it is good to build a solid understanding of how the `.git` directory relates to your working directory.


So far, even though we have hashed the object, git still thinks the file is untracked, because it is not in the tree and there are no commits that point to that part of the tree.

## Updating the Index

Now, we can add our file as it is to the index. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 \
> 83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
error: option 'cacheinfo' expects <mode>,<sha1>,<path>
```

- the `\` lets us wrap onto a second line, the `>` above is the new prompt for the second line
- this the plumbing command `git update-index` updates (or in this case creates an index, the staging area of our repository)
- the `--add` option is because the file doesnât yet exist in our staging area (we donât even have a staging area set up yet)
- `--cacheinfo` because the file we're adding isnât in your directory but is in the database.
- in this case, weâre specifying a mode of 100644, which means itâs a normal file.
- then the hash object we want to add to the index (the content) in our case, we want the hash of the first version of the file, not the most recent one.
- finally the file name of that content

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

I forgot the file name above, so I used my up arrow key to get the command back: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30 test.txt
```

note that the `\` I originally typed and the `>` from the prompt are not there.


this command had no output, so let check git status. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Again, we check in with status
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

```
We have the files staged as expected
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now the file is staged. 

Let's edit it further. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "version 2" >> test.txt 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can look at the content to ensure it as expected
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat test.txt 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
version 1
version 2
```
So the file has two lines
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Now check status again. 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```

We added the first version of the file to the staging area, so that version is ready to commit  but we have changed the version in our working directory relative to the version from the hash object that we put in the staging area so we *also* have changes not staged.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we can see we do not yet have a new object for the new version of the file

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can hash and store this version too. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git hash-object -w test.txt 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
0c1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can then look again at our list of objects. 


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
:emphasize-lines: 1
.git/objects//0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

our new object is there with the first two



+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

```{mermaid}
classDiagram
    class d67046{
        +"test content"
        +(blob)
    }
    class 83baae{
       +Version 1
       +(blob)
    }
    class 0c1e73{
        +Version 1
        +Verson 2
        +(blob)
    }
```

So now our repo has 3 items, all blobs

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```

hashing the object does not impact the index, which is what git status uses


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Preparing to Commit

When we work with porcelain commands, we use add then commit.  We have staged the file, which we know is  what happens when we add.  What else has to happen to make a commit.  

We know that commits are comprised of:
- a message
- author and times stamp info
- a pointer to a tree
- a pointer to the parent (except the first commit)

We do not have any of these items yet.  

Let's make a tree next. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Now we can write a tree from the index,

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git write-tree
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
d8329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
```

and we get a hash

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Lets examine the tree, first check the type

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -t d832
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
tree
```
it is as expected


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and now we can look at its contents
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]

two blobs that are unlinked to anything and one blob that is included in a tree

Again, we will check in with git via `git status`


```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```

Nothing has changed, making the tree does not yet make the commit


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



This only keeps track of the objects, there are also still the HEAD that we have not dealt with and the index.

### Creating a commit manually

We can echo a commit message through a pipe into the commit-tree plumbing function to commit a particular hashed object.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

the `git commit-tree` command requires a message via  stdin and the tree hash.  We will use stdin and a pipe for the message

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo "first commit" | git commit-tree d832
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
097898b3f2a5a10f2adb96931da78666ff858002
```


and we get back a hash. But notice that this hash is unique for each of us. Because the commit has information about the time stamp and our user.  


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we can look at this object too: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p 0978
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
tree d8329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
author Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1729186238 -0400
committer Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1729186238 -0400

first commit
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



The above hash is the one I got during class, but I did this previously I had a different hash (`d450567fec96cbd8dd514313db9bcb96ad7664b0`) even though I have the same name and e-mail because the time changed.





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


We can also look at its type
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -t 0978
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
commit
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



Now we check the final list of objects that we have for today

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
find .git/objects/ -type f
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
:emphasize-lines: 4
.git/objects//0c/1e7391ca4e59584f8b773ecdbbb9467eba1547
.git/objects//d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4

.git/objects//83/baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30
```

You should also have 5 objects like me, 3 blobs, one tree, one commit. 
Four of your objects (blobs & tree) will have the same has, but your commit
will have a different hash.  I highlghted my commit, that is the one that 
you should **not** have.

## What does git status do? 

_compares the working directory to the current state of the active branch_


- we cansee the working directory with: `ls`
- we can see the active branch in the `HEAD` file 
- what is its status? 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   test.txt

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



we see it is "on main" this is because we set the branch to main , but since we have not written there, we have to do it directly. Notice that when we use the porcelain command for commit, it does this automatically; the porcelain commands do many things.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Notice, git says we have no commits yet even though we have written a commit. 

In our case because we made the commit manually, we did not update the branch. 

 This is because the main branch does not *point* to any commit.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We can check that a commit type object exists
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -t 0978
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
commit
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}



We can verify by looking at the `HEAD` file
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/HEAD 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
ref: refs/heads/main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and then viewing that file
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat .git/refs/heads/main
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
cat: .git/refs/heads/main: No such file or directory
```
which does not even exist!
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we can also look at the folder where branch pointer files typicall live

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls .git/refs/heads/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}


nothing exists there yet!


```{code-block} console
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Git References





+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can make that file manually

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
echo 097898b3f2a5a10f2adb96931da78666ff858002> .git/refs/heads/main
```

````{important}
This file needs to have the **full** hash, not only a few digits.
````



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and back to git status
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git status
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
On branch main
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   test.txt

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
```

now it is as we expect!

## Questions After Today's Class 

### How can certain parts of commits be accessed and pulled for use?

We saw that we can look at the output of the `git cat-file` command. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p 0978 
```
 This tells us the tree (which would tell us the blobs) and any future commits would have a parent too. Let's focus on the tree and try to extract it. 
```{code-block} console
:emphasize-lines: 1
tree d8329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
author Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1729186238 -0400
committer Sarah M Brown <brownsarahm@uri.edu> 1729186238 -0400

first commit
```

We can pipe this output into another command to take a subset of it.  

This could be a custom written tool (see python click library for example) or you can use `sed` with a regex like expression. This is a really detailed task that is a good use of a generative AI tool. I knew *what* I wanted to do, but could not remember if it was `sed` or `awk` that was the right tool and the regex syntax is not something I use enough to retain.  So I asked an LLM "sed or awk to extract the parent of a commit from the git cat-file output" and it gave me:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
git cat-file -p 0978 | sed -n 's/^tree \(.*\)/\1/p'
```

which I ran to confirm that it worked
```{code-block} console
d8329fc1cc938780ffdd9f94e0d364e0ea74f579
```

### how to remove objects after running git commit -tree?

they are files you can delete them with `rm`

### Different between tree and blob?

blobs contain the *content* of the file, a tree contains a *listing* of the 
files in a snapshot (or single folder within a snapshot) that 
associates the blob objects to their file names. 

### Because of the nature of how git works off of files, if I were to change the ref head for a branch to point to main's current pointer- would it then contain the same contents?

Yes the branch is just a pointer to a particular commit, as PR compares the branches by showing the 
changes to the files between the snapshots at those two commits.
