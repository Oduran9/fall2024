## Why do we need to know about this? 


- computers are not magic and edge cases help you see that
- in case you want to do high performance programming
- it's good practice with abstraction

## Hardware vs Software abstraction


Abstraction is to remove details and use higher level units 



![abstraction layers](../img/)


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


in hardware our abstractions are less leaky becuase it is less forgiving.  

software abstractions can suffer from leaks; think git- it's hard to learn because the abstraction is leaky. 



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}


a lot of programming is *designing* abstractions, to get good at making something, you study examples first- good and bad- to learn what to do, and not to do.
