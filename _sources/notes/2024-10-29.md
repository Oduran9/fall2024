# What happens when I build code in C?




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}
## What is *buiding* code?

Building is transforming code from the input format to the final format.  

This can mean different things in different contexts. For example:
- the course website is built from markdown files in to html output using jupyter-book
- a C program is built  C source code to executable as the output

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We sometimes say that compiling takes code from source to executable, but this process is actually multiple stages and compiling is *one* of those steps.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will focus on *what* has to happen more than *how* it all happens.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
CSC301, 402, 501, 502 go into greater detail on how languages work.  

Our goal is to:

- (where applicable) give you a preview
- get enough understanding of what happens to know where to look when debugging

## Using ssh keys to authenticate

1. generate a key pair
1. store the public key on the server
1. Request to login, tell server your public key, get back a session ID from the server
1. if it has that public key, then it generates a random string, encrypts it with your public key and sends it back to your computer
1. On your computer, it decrypts the message + the session ID with your private key then hashes the message and sends it back
1. the server then hashes its copy of the message and session ID and if the hash received and calculated match, then you are loggied in

## Generating a Key Pair

We can use `ssh-keygen` to create a keys.

- `-f` option allows us to specify the file name of the keys.
- `-t` option allows us to specify the encryption algorithm 
- `-b` option allows us to specify the size of the key in bits

## A simple program

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano hello.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat hello.c 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "site","type":"output"}

and we will put in a simple hello world 
program

```{code-block} C
#include <stdio.h>
void main () {

 printf("Hello world\n");

}
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we will confirm that it exists

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
hello.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Preprocessing with gcc

First we handle the preprocessing which pulls in headers that are included.  We will use the compiler
[gcc](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/gcc.1.html)


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will use `gcc` for many steps, and use its options to have it do subsets of what it can possibly do: 

- `-E` stops after preprocessing
- `-o` makes it write the .i file and passes the file name for it
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -E -o hello.i hello.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
If it succeeds, we see no output, but we can check the folder


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
hello.c  hello.i
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

now we have a new file

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we can check the size
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -l
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
total 24
-rw-r--r--. 1 brownsarahm spring2022-csc392    64 Oct 29 12:58 hello.c
-rw-r--r--. 1 brownsarahm spring2022-csc392 16865 Oct 29 13:00 hello.i
```


+++{"lesson_part": "prismia"}

If we think that the `.i` file might be big, what can we use to compare the two to see the impact of preprocesing?

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can inspect what it does using `wc`

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
wc -l hello*
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
    6 hello.c
  842 hello.i
  848 total
```

we started with just 6 lines of code and we get a lot more after preprocessing


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Since it is long, we will fist look at the top

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
head hello.i
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
# 1 "hello.c"
# 1 "<built-in>"
# 1 "<command-line>"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdc-predef.h" 1 3 4
# 1 "<command-line>" 2
# 1 "hello.c"
# 1 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 1 3 4
# 27 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 3 4
# 1 "/usr/include/features.h" 1 3 4
# 375 "/usr/include/features.h" 3 4
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and the end

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
tail hello.i
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

extern void funlockfile (FILE *__stream) __attribute__ ((__nothrow__ , __leaf__));
# 943 "/usr/include/stdio.h" 3 4

# 2 "hello.c" 2
void main () {

 printf("Hello world\n");

}
```

we see that our original program, is at the end of the file, and the beginning is where the include line has been expanded. 

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

````{margin}
```{admonition} Try it yourself
Look at this whole file, try changing the base program to remove the include and then see what the preprocessed file is like
```

```{note}
I have set this cell to use C syntax highlighting even though on a terminal output it would not
```
````
+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Compiling

Next we take our preprocessed file and compile it to get assembly code.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Again, we use `gcc`:
- `-S` tells it to produce assembly
- we will use the preprocessed file as input

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -S hello.i
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

but we can see what it output: 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
hello.c  hello.i  hello.s
```

we have a new file as well with the `.s` extension. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we can use `man` to see docs for any command
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
man gcc
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we get a new file
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -l
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
total 28
-rw-r--r--. 1 brownsarahm spring2022-csc392    64 Oct 29 12:58 hello.c
-rw-r--r--. 1 brownsarahm spring2022-csc392 16865 Oct 29 13:00 hello.i
-rw-r--r--. 1 brownsarahm spring2022-csc392   433 Oct 29 13:06 hello.s
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
we can see how long it is in lines too
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
wc -l hello.s
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
25 hello.s
```

this is longer than the source, but not as long as the header. The header contains lots of information that we *might* need, but the assembly is only what we *do*. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

And it's manageable, so we inspect it directly: 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat hello.s
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
	.file	"hello.c"
	.section	.rodata
.LC0:
	.string	"Hello world"
	.text
	.globl	main
	.type	main, @function
main:
.LFB0:
	.cfi_startproc
	pushq	%rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa_offset 16
	.cfi_offset 6, -16
	movq	%rsp, %rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa_register 6
	movl	$.LC0, %edi
	call	puts
	popq	%rbp
	.cfi_def_cfa 7, 8
	ret
	.cfi_endproc
.LFE0:
	.size	main, .-main
	.ident	"GCC: (GNU) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-44)"
	.section	.note.GNU-stack,"",@progbits
```

There are many more steps and they are lower level operations, but it is text stored in the file.



+++{"lesson_part": "site"}
```{hint}
Learning more about assembly languages is a good explore badge topic
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}


## Assembling


Assembling is to take the assembly code and get object code.  Assembly is relatively broad and there are families of assembly code, it is also still written *for humans* to understand it readily.  It's more complex than source code because it is closer to the hardware.  The object code however, is specific instructions to your machine and not human readable.



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Again, with `gcc`:
- `-c` tells it to stop at the object file
- `-o` again gives it the name of the file to write

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -c -o hello.o hello.s 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

Again, check what it does by looking at files

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -l
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
total 32
-rw-r--r--. 1 brownsarahm spring2022-csc392    64 Oct 29 12:58 hello.c
-rw-r--r--. 1 brownsarahm spring2022-csc392 16865 Oct 29 13:00 hello.i
-rw-r--r--. 1 brownsarahm spring2022-csc392  1496 Oct 29 13:14 hello.o
-rw-r--r--. 1 brownsarahm spring2022-csc392   433 Oct 29 13:06 hello.s
```
now we see a new file, the `.o`



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and again check its length

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
wc -l hello.o
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
5 hello.o
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we can check how many characters and words

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
wc  hello.o
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
   5   17 1496 hello.o
```

it is not even too many characters

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
wc  hello.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
 6  9 64 hello.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cat hello.o
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

```
this is not human readable though
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

This file is written in binary, but our terminal reads it back in 8 bit chunks.  To get an idea, imagine we had a small object language
where there were 4 total operations: 
- pick a memory location (00)
- store a value (01)
- add (10)
- move value to ALU (11)

In this case code like:
```
a = 1
b = 2
c = a+ b
```

Would get translated into assembly:
```
pick memory 0
store 1
pick memory 1
store 2
move to ALU location 0
move to ALU location 1
add ALU
```

and then object code like:
```
00 00
01 01
00 01
01 10
11 00
11 01
11 00
```

then the terminal read it in 8 bit chunks
```
00000101 0001010 11001101 11000000
```

which would render as characters according to utf-8 or ascii or whatever encoding your system uses as characters numbered: 
5,10,205,192


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

## Linking

Now we can link it all together; in this program there are not a lot of other depdencies, but this fills in anything from libraries and outputs an executble



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

once again with `gcc`:
-  `-o` flag specifies the name for output
-  `-lm` tells it to link from the .o file.


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -o  hello hello.o -lm
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
hello  hello.c  hello.i  hello.o  hello.s
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Finally we can run our program

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
./hello 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Hello world
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls -l
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
./hello 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Hello world
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
## Putting it all together


We can repeat with a different name and work directly from source to executable: 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -o demohello hello.c -lm
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
demohello  hello  hello.c  hello.i  hello.o  hello.s
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
and run again. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
./demohello 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Hello world
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Working with multiple files

This all looks a bit different if we have our code split across files.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

we will make a new file `main.c`

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano main.c
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

with the following content
```{code-block} C
/* Used to illustrate separate compilation.
Created: Joe Zachary, October 22, 1992
Modified:
*/

#include <stdio.h>

void main () {
 int n;
 printf("Please enter a small positive integer: ");
 scanf("%d", &n);
 printf("The sum of the first n integers is %d\n", sum(n));
 printf("The product of the first n integers is %d\n", product(n));
}
```
+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Then `help.c` 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
nano help.c
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} C
/* Used to illustrate separate compilation

Created: Joe Zachary, October 22, 1992
Modified:

*/

/* Requires that "n" be positive. Returns the sum of the
  first "n" integers. */

int sum (int n) {
 int i;
 int total = 0;
 for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
  total += i;
 return(total);
}


/* Requires that "n" be positive. Returns the product of the
  first "n" integers. */

int product (int n) {
 int i;
 int total = 1;
 for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
  total *= i;
 return(total);
}
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
now we can compile each part:

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -Wall -g -c  main.c 
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
main.c:8:6: warning: return type of ‘main’ is not ‘int’ [-Wmain]
 void main () {
      ^
main.c: In function ‘main’:
main.c:12:2: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘sum’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  printf("The sum of the first n integers is %d\n", sum(n));
  ^
main.c:13:2: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘product’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  printf("The product of the first n integers is %d\n", product(n));
  ^
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Now we preprocess, compile and assemble the helper code: 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -Wall -g -c help.c 
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
then we can link it all together

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
gcc -o demo main.o help.o -lm
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
 and run our program 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
./demo
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Please enter a small positive integer: 3
The sum of the first n integers is 6
The product of the first n integers is 6
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
./demo
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Please enter a small positive integer: 8
The sum of the first n integers is 36
The product of the first n integers is 40320
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

and finally exit from seawulf

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
exit
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
logout
Connection to seawulf.uri.edu closed.
```

## Questions After Today's Class 

### What's the process like for an interpreted language, like python?

An interpreter reads and executes each line in a {term}`REPL` 
or it runs the script file like how bash runs the shell.  

More details of the steps for an interpretted language is a good explore badge topic. 

### Is it possible to not link everything together?


If you do not link, then it's not executable. 

### what do other compilers have that gcc dont have. Why have different options versus a standard for c++ for example?

Different compilers will mostly have different optimization. but this is also a good explore badge topic. 

### are the steps that we did in class are similar when working with languages other than C

they are pretty common for compiled langauges, but comparing and contrasting with other languages like Rust could be a good explore badge. 

### What programming languages can we use in nano mode other than C++?

You can work with *any* programming language in *any* text editor, all programming languages are plain text. 

### What steps does an interpreter abstract? Is it an addition in the beginning of the compilation process or is it an entirely different process?

It's different completely, for example most Python interpretters are written in C, so the interpretter is compiled like this process, but then in parses and runs the code interactively. 

### Is there any benefit to being able to read a low level language?

Obscure skills can often pay well.

Also, a low level language is needed for working on resource constrained hardware.  It can also be used for creating drivers to connect hardware to a computer, like peripherals.
