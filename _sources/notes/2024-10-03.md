# How do programmers communicate about code? 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{tip}
check if your codespace has uncommitted changes on [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces)

note: 
- you can only have 2 active at a time(green dots)
- you can see if any have uncommitted changes
- you can [export those changes to a branch](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/troubleshooting/exporting-changes-to-a-branch) from this page
```

## Why Documentation

Today we will talk about documentation, there are several reasons this is important: 
- **using** official documentation is the best way to get better at the tools
- understanding how documentation is designed and built will help you use it better
- **writing** and  **maintaining** documentation is really important part of working on a team
- documentation building tools are a type of developer tool (and these are generally good software design)
  



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Design is best learned from examples. Some of the best examples of software *design* come from developer tools. 

- [source (js version)](https://third-bit.com/sdxjs/)
- [source (python version)](https://third-bit.com/sdxpy/)






+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

In particular documentation tools are really good examples of: 
- pattern matching
- modularity and abstraction
- automation
- the build process beyond compiling



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"outcomes"}

By the end of today's class you will be able to:
- describe different types of documentation
- generate documentation as html 

Plus we will reinforce things we have already seen: 
- paths
- good file naming

## What is documentation 

[documentation types table](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1/tables/1)

from [ethnography of docuemtnation data science](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10606-018-9333-1)





+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Why is documentation so important?

we should probably spend more time on it

![differenc ein time spent vs should](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs10606-018-9333-1/MediaObjects/10606_2018_9333_Fig4_HTML.png?as=webp)

[source](https://bids.berkeley.edu/news/most-developers-think-we-should-spend-more-time-documentation)




+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## So, *how* do we do it? 

Different types of documentation live in different places and we use tools to maintain them. 

As developers, we rely on code to do things that are easy for computers and hard for people.

[Documenation Tools](https://docathon.github.io/docathon/pages/resources.html#documentation-tools)



[write the docs](https://www.writethedocs.org/)

[linux kernel uses sphinx](https://lwn.net/Articles/705224/) and here is [why](https://lwn.net/Articles/692704/) and [how it works](https://lwn.net/Articles/692705/)



+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

## Jupyterbook 

[Jupyterbook](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html) wraps sphinx and uses markdown instead of restructured text. The project authors [note in the documenation](https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/explain/sphinx.html) that it "can be thought of as an *opinionated distribution of Sphinx*". We're goign to use this. 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

navigate to your  folder for this course (mine is `inclass/systems`)

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We can confirm that `jupyter-book` is installed by checking the version. 


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
jupyter-book --version
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
Jupyter Book      : 1.0.2
External ToC      : 1.0.1
MyST-Parser       : 2.0.0
MyST-NB           : 1.1.1
Sphinx Book Theme : 1.1.3
Jupyter-Cache     : 1.0.0
NbClient          : 0.10.0
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Let's look at the status of this folder to set a baseline before we run new commands. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fall24-brownsarahm	gh-inclass-brownsarahm
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

We will run a command to create a jupyterbook from a template, the command has 3 parts: 
- `jupyter-book` is a program (the thing we installed)
- `create` is a subcommand (one action that program can do)
- `tiny-book` is an argument (a mandatory input to that action)



```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
jupyter-book create tiny-book
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

===============================================================================

Your book template can be found at

    tiny-book/

===============================================================================

```


+++{"lesson_part": "site","type":"margin"}

````{margin}
```{tip}
This is *structurally* similar to `git add .`

- `git` is a program
- `add` is a subcommand
- `.` is a path, and an argument
```
````


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
 but it does an unrelated thing, we can use `ls` to check again to see more of what happened beyond the annoucnement above
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}
we have a new folder!
```{code-block} console
fall24-brownsarahm	tiny-book
gh-inclass-brownsarahm
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
You can make it with any name: 
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
jupyter-book create example
```

beacuse the name is an argument or input
+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console

===============================================================================

Your book template can be found at

    example/

===============================================================================

```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
Each one makes a directory, we can see by listing

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
example			gh-inclass-brownsarahm
fall24-brownsarahm	tiny-book
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
And we can delete the second one since we do not actually want it. 

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
rm example/
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
rm: example/: is a directory
```
we get an error because it is not well defined to delete a directory, and potentially risky, so `rm` is written to throw an error


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Instead, we have to tell it two additional things: 
- to delete recusively `r`
- to force it to do something risky with `f`
  
*note* we can stack single character options together with a single `-`
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
rm -rf example/
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
fall24-brownsarahm	tiny-book
gh-inclass-brownsarahm
```

## Structure of a Jupyter book


+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
cd tiny-book/
```



+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
We will explore the output by looking at the files
```{code-cell} bash
:tags: ["skip-execution"]
ls
```

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"output"}

```{code-block} console
_config.yml		markdown.md
_toc.yml		notebooks.ipynb
intro.md		references.bib
logo.png		requirements.txt
markdown-notebooks.md
```


A jupyter book has two required files (`_config.yml` and `_toc.yml`), some for content, and some helpers that are common but not required. 

- [config defaults](https://jupyterbook.org/customize/config.html#configuration-defaults)
- [toc file formatting rules](https://jupyterbook.org/structure/toc.html#structure-of-a-book)
- the `*.md` files are content
- the `.bib` file is bibiolography information
- The other files are optional, but common. [Requirements.txt](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#requirements-files) is the format for pip to install python depndencies. There are different standards in other languages for how



+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

```{note}
the extention (`.yml`) is [yaml](https://yaml.org/), which stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". It consists of key, value pairs and is deigned to be a human-friendly way to encode data for use in any programming language.
```


+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

### Dev tools mean we do not have to write bibliographies manually

bibliographies are generated with [bibtex](http://www.bibtex.org/) which takes structured information from the references in a [bibtex file](http://www.bibtex.org/Format/) with help from [sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

For general reference, reference managers like [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) and [mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) can track all of your sources and output the references in bibtex format that you can use anywhere or sync with tools like MS Word or Google Docs.

**this is not a git repo** it is only a folder we have made locally

```{code-cell} bash

Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to improve the effciency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using commonly-Available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events.

Cognitive neuroscience has seen rapid growth in the size and complexity of data recorded from the human brain as well as in the computational tools available to analyze this data. This data explosion has resulted in an increased use of multivariate, model-based methods for asking neuroscience questions, allowing scientists to investigate multiple hypotheses with a single dataset, to use complex, time-varying stimuli, and to study the human brain under more naturalistic conditions. These tools come in the form of “Encoding” models, in which stimulus features are used to model brain activity, and “Decoding” models, in which neural features are used to generated a stimulus output. Here we review the current state of encoding and decoding models in cognitive electrophysiology and provide a practical guide toward conducting experiments and analyses in this emerging field. Our examples focus on using linear models in the study of human language and audition. We show how to calculate auditory receptive fields from natural sounds as well as how to decode neural recordings to predict speech. The paper aims to be a useful tutorial to these approaches, and a practical introduction to using machine learning and applied statistics to build models of neural activity. The data analytic approaches we discuss may also be applied to other sensory modalities, motor systems, and cognitive systems, and we cover some examples in these areas. In addition, a collection of Jupyter notebooks is publicly available as a complement to the material covered in this paper, providing code examples and tutorials for predictive modeling in python. The aimis to provide a practical understanding of predictivemodeling of human brain data and to propose best-practices in conducting these analyses.},

## YAML files let us set parameters in a file

The table of contents file describe how to put the other files in order.

```{code-block} yaml

:filename: _toc.yml
# Table of contents
# Learn more at https://jupyterbook.org/customize/toc.html

The first two lines are comments, the pound sign `#` is a comment in bash and 
YAML. Here, the developers chose, in the template to put information about how to
set up this file right in the template file.  This is developers helping their users!


```{code-block} yaml
:linenos:
:lineno-start:4
:filename: _toc.yml
format: jb-book
root: intro
```
The first next two lines are key value pairs that tell the high level settings


```{code-block} yaml
:linenos:
:lineno-start:6
:filename: _toc.yml
chapters:
- file: markdown
- file: notebooks
- file: markdown-notebooks
```

the end of the file shows a list of files that will be treated as chapters.  This is also the syntax
for a list in YAML, the list is named `chapters` and each item, starting with a `-` has a single key, `file`

````{admonition} Where have we seen a YAML list?

You can create a community badge that uses as the location of the "contribution" 
a link to the snipped to a set of lines in your main fall24 repo that is a YAML 
list.  This is valid as long as it is created before lab time on Monday October

### Retiring racist language
Historically the default branch in git was called master. `jupyter-book` has that as default

- [derived from a master/slave analogy](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html) which is not even how git works, but was adopted terminology from other projects
- [GitHub no longer does](https://github.com/github/renaming)
- [the broader community is changing as well](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/)
- [git allows you to make your default not be master](https://lore.kernel.org/git/pull.656.v4.git.1593009996.gitgitgadget@gmail.com/)
- [literally the person who chose the names "master" and "origin" regrets that choice](https://twitter.com/xpasky/status/1271477451756056577) the name main is a more accurate and not harmful term and the current convention.

## Documentation engines use patterns

These are a structure that a lot of programming languages and other contexts 

See examples in other langauges in their documentation: 
- [rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/)
- [`fmt` package in go](https://pkg.go.dev/fmt)
- [java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/ref_string_format.asp)
- the [liquid templating language](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) is used for shopify and used in a few other technologies
