# How do I choose a Programming Language for a project?

+++{"lesson_part": "main","type":"heading"}

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Today we'll explore how programming languages are cateogrized. Along the way, this will expose what core, generic features of a programming language are.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

The key takeaway that I want for your is to have intution for how to choose a language for a project, not only your favorite, but what is the best for different types of projects.

+++{"lesson_part": "site"}

```{tip}
You should do *either* the `in groups` (if in class) or the `on your own` sections below for the x.x.x. For the x.x sections do all of them.
```

```{important}
 Use the makeup workflow with an [ISO formated date](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) (YYYY-MM-DD)) if you work asynchronously.  If in class you can do a regular experience badge. 
```

##  Comparing languages you know

Tak a few minutes on your own to fill in the follwing table for two languages of your choice. Replace the `<langugage>` with two languages that you are familiar with. Add two additional rows. You can do this by memory, or by looking up/discussing. If you look things up, be sure to use reputable sources and include links to them.  

In class you can work on this on a whiteboard or on your computer.

```markdown
| feature | <language1> | <language2> |
| ++++++-- | ++++++-- | ++++++-- |
| use of whitespace     | Text     | Text     |
| list/array types |   | |
| variable typing |  | | 
| memory usage | | | 
```

### In groups

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}
````{margin}
```{hint}
Use a [cryptad "code" file](https://cryptpad.fr/) or similar to collaborate live on a markdown file (one person can create and then share the url, no one will need an account).  You could add the tables all to the one file so that you can all see one another's tables
```
````
Share your table with some classmates and then discuss how they are similar and different.  

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Together, produce a list of questions for what other things you would want to know about how programming languages compare.  All of you should include the collaboratively developed list in your experience report.

### On your own

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

Think of a few questions about how you might compare programming languages. 

Try to find high quality answers for them, from reputable sources.  You can use an AI to find preliminary answers, but you need to find high quality sources to fact check and make sure you do not confuse yourself with incorrect information from a chatbot

### In groups 

You can divde the sources up and then discuss. 

Discuss the readings, in particular: 
- what you found most interesting
- was anything new to you? 
- what do you want to remember most or learn more about? 

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

### On your own 

Add notes on broader patterns below your table in your experience report based on reading the sources above. 

Answer each of the following questions with specific references to the readings:
- what you found most interesting
- was anything new to you? 
- what do you want to remember most 
- what do you want to learn more about?

## PL in Developer Survey


Resources:
-  the most recent [developer survey// languages section](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)
- Additional reading about the languages from their official references if needed to answer the following questions.

+++{"lesson_part": "main"}

### With classmates

First discuss your prepare work then go back to the survey results to find more information and answer the following. 

Discuss the findings to answer the following questions. This discussion should be at least 10-15 minutes including looking up information about different languages. As a group, you may divide and conquer this research. 
- what is surprising?
- what did you expect?
- what do the popular languages have in common?
- what do the dreaded languages have in common?
- How are popular vs dreaded languages different? What features might be the cause for making a language dreaded?
- How to used languages differ from less commonly used languages? What features might be the cause for making a languge popular? 
- How have things changed since 2011? 



Include (shared) notes from the discussion in your experience report. 
Reflect (individually) on a few key points (2-3 bullet points) from the discussion in your experience report for today. 

<!-- if instructor absent: Include the names of your group mates that you discussed with. -->
