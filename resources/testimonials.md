# Testimonials from Fall 2024 Students

The best way to be sucessful in this course is to stay on top of your work, use the resources offered to you, and to follow a plan to achieve the grade you want to achieve. I fell behind in the class due to personal reasons, I also fell behind because I thought I was caught up or thought I didn't have any particular work to complete but I actually did. I was also doing a decent amount of work in other classes and that took up a lot of my time, so I didn't prioritize this course heavily which is something I should've done. 
I also regret not using office hours as often or asking more questions in class time. Don't be shy it may seem intimidating but the professor will provide an answer that will definitely give you a better understanding. Lastly, just follow the plan you set for yourself and keep at it, it'll keep you in line and you can give or take depending on how you feel throughout the semester.
